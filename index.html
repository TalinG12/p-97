<h3>Q. What is nanotechnology used for? </h3><br>
<h4>Ans. 
    Nanotechnology is helping to considerably improve, even revolutionize, many technology and industry sectors:<br> information technology, homeland security, medicine, transportation,<br> energy, food safety, and environmental science<br>, among many others.</h4>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Q. What is the problem with nanotechnology? </h3><br>
    <h4>Ans. 
        Nanoparticles can get into the body through the skin, lungs and digestive system.<br> This may help create 'free radicals' which can cause cell damage and damage to the DNA.<br> There is also concern that once nanoparticles are in the bloodstream they will be <br> to cross the blood-brain barrier.    </h4>

        <h3> Q. How can we use it?</h3>

        <h4>Ans. Energy Applications
            Nanotechnology is improving the efficiency of fuel production from<br> raw petroleum materials through better catalysis.<br> It is also enabling reduced fuel consumption<br> in vehicles and power plants through higher-efficiency combustion and decreased friction.</h4>
